We’re looking for a highly technical, customer-focused Solutions Engineer to interface between our customers and our product teams. This key role will support the adoption of Forestry products (Tina CMS & Forestry CMS) in new organizations and help our product team understand the needs of our customers.

As the first hire of its kind at Forestry, there will be a lot of opportunities for impact and growth. We want to help our clients implement high-quality, successful JAMstack solutions, and this role will be front and center in that effort. Our first Solutions Engineer will help set the high standards by which we do this going forward.

## About Forestry.io

Forestry.io is on a mission to help people build a better web. We’re building a Git-backed content management system (CMS) and an open source site-editing toolkit ([TinaCMS](https://tinacms.org "TinaCMS")) -both focused on the JAMstack.

We’re a growing team, headquartered in PEI, Canada with roughly half our staff working remotely (we're 100% remote during the COVID-19 situation). We take our time hiring, and we hire for the person, not simply for the role. We value respect and empathy and we strive to reflect those values in our hiring process.
