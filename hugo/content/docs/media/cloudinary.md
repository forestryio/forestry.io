Forestry supports storing your **images** in your own [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) cloud.

{{% warning %}} Cloudinary is considered beta as we don't support uploading and inserting video files in your content. {{% /warning %}}

## Linking Your Cloudinary Account

![Forestry Cloudinary Settings](/uploads/2018/05/cloudinary-settings.png)

1. [Sign up for a Cloudinary account](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free)
2. Log in to your dashboard and click the cog icon to access your settings. You should see your **Cloudinary cloud name** at the bottom of this page. Make note of this value.
3. Click the **Security** tab and scroll to the bottom to see your API credentials.
4. Open up your site's dashboard in Forestry and navigate to the **Settings** section, and select the **Media** tab.
5. Under **Media Management**, select **Cloudinary**. You should see fields appear for **Cloud name**, **API key**, and **API secret**.
6. Enter your Cloudinary info into these fields and click the **Save Settings** button.
7. Navigate to the **Media** section in the Forestry dashboard. If you see the Cloudinary sample image in your library, you are successfully connected!

## Recommended Path Settings

You will want to adjust your paths in the **Media** section to work with Cloudinary.

* **Public Path**: You will want to enter the full URL to your Cloudinary cloud. This will look something like `https://res.cloudinary.com/{{ CLOUD_NAME }}/image/upload/`.
* **Front Matter Path:** Activate the toggle in this section to use a different **public path** when inserting an image into front matter, and leave the value empty. This will allow you to easily insert URL transformations ([see below](#using-cloudinary-images)).

### For Jekyll users
Your media directory is:
* **Public Path:** `/image/upload/c_scale,w_auto:100,dpr_auto/`
* **Front Matter Path:** `/image/upload/`

Note: `image/upload` is your own directory (manually created) in Cloudinary.

### Applying transforms to markdown content

Your markdown content will not have any transforms applied by default. To apply transforms to all of your markdown images, you can use the **public path** and **front matter path** separately.

E.g:

* **Public Path:** `https://res.cloudinary.com/{{ CLOUD_NAME }}/image/upload/c_scale,w_auto:100,dpr_auto/`
* **Front Matter Path:** `https://res.cloudinary.com/{{ CLOUD_NAME }}/image/upload/`

## Migrating Existing Media

Currently, we are not able to automatically migrate existing media from a git repo to a user's Cloudinary account. We recommend logging in to your Cloudinary dashboard and bulk uploading your images there. After the images are in your Cloudinary account, they will also appear in your Media Library in Forestry.

Unfortunately, for the time being, you will need to manually update your front matter to reassign the new images.

## Using Cloudinary Images

Cloudinary supports a vast array of image manipulation options that can be implemented directly in the image URL. Cloudinary has [so many transformation options](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformations) that, rather than attempt to support a subset of them in our UI, we have instead decided to make it easy for developers to configure these image transformations themselves in the site's templates.

When adding a Cloudinary image to a front matter field, Forestry will only save the base filename in the page's front matter, like this:

    ---
    main_image: img.png
    #...
    ---

When using these images in your templates, you should prepend them with the URL to your cloud. We recommend storing this URL in your site's configuration and referencing it via variable in your templates. For example, in a Hugo site you might put the following in `config.toml`:

    cloudinary_url = "https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload"

You could then use these front matter images in your templates as follows:

    <img src="{{ .Site.cloudinary_url }}/{{ .Params.main_image }}" />

Using this approach, adding in one or more transformations is easy and transparent:

    <img src="{{ .Site.cloudinary_url }}/w_250,h_250,c_fill/{{ .Params.main_image }}">
