Pick up _your_ favorite continuous delivery service to publish your static website.

As a headless CMS, Forestry's responsibility is to provide a user-interface for editors and developers working with static sites hosted in a Git repository. When it comes to automate your deployments and host your static website on a CDN, it's the responsibility of a continuous deployment and hosting service.
