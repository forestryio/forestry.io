Jekyll is one of the oldest static site generators available. Built by [GitHub][1], it has tons of community support and is very stable. Additional features can be added onto Jekyll through the use of plugins. It also uses the templating language [Liquid][2], which feels very familiar to developers and is also used by Shopify and other large-scale applications. 

### Choose Jekyll if you:

* Want a static site generator with great stability and the biggest community.
* Have a small site, like a portfolio or marketing site.
* Are comfortable with PHP, JS, Ruby, or Python, as Jekyll’s templating language will feel very familiar.
* Know building your own theme is not an interest, as Jekyll has a rich theme library

### Don’t choose Jekyll if you:

* Are building a smaller site that needs a lot of enterprise features, as Jekyll doesn’t support these out-of-the-box.
* Have a site with more than 500 pages, as Jekyll can be slow with large page counts.

--incorrect.
jekyll is built from liquid- the engine that shopify uses. so the argument is wrong. see also: http://cheat.markdunkley.com/ it works and integrates well with shopify and stripe. my site uses it but the cart isnt live yet. https://southernhedgehogs.org

## Getting Started
To get started developing for Jekyll, you’ll need a basic understanding of HTML and [Liquid][2], Jekyll's templating language. You’ll also likely want to [set up your local development environment][3].

We also recommend that you set up a Git repository to manage development of your site. Doing so offers you free backups, enables [content sync][5] with the CMS, and enables you to use [continuous deployment][6].
