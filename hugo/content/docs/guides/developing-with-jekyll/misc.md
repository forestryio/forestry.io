## Sitemaps/Feeds
Jekyll has no built-in support for Sitemaps or Feeds, but there are a multitude of community plugins to add this functionality. See the references below for more info.

## Menus
Jekyll does not have built-in support for menus. Forestry has built a [Jekyll menus][1] plugin that integrates with the Menu Manager of the CMS.
