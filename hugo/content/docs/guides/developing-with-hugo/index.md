Hugo is a *fast* static site generator, with a *lot* of enterprise features. If you’re building a large business, publication, or community website Hugo is likely the right choice due to features likes localization, RSS Feed & Sitemap generation, and much more.

### Choose Hugo if you:

* Are building a site that requires a lot of enterprise features, such customizable as RSS Feeds, Sitemaps, AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages), etc.
* Have a site with more than 500 pages, as Hugo is blazingly fast 
* Feel learning a new language to build your theme templates isn’t a challenge for you.
* Know building a custom theme is something you’re interested in.

### Don’t choose Hugo if you:

* Are only experienced with HTML & CSS and have never worked with a programming language like JS, PHP, Ruby, GoLang, etc.
* Are not comfortable learning a completely new language to build your HTML templates with.
* Are not comfortable implementing complex features like Sitemaps, RSS Feeds, etc.

## Getting Started
To get started developing for Hugo, you’ll need a basic understanding of HTML and GoLang, Hugo’s default templating language. You’ll also likely want to [set up your local development environment][1].

We also recommend that you set up a Git repository to manage development of your site. Doing so offers you free backups, enables content sync with the CMS, and enables you to use [continuous deployment][3].

<!-- Once you’re ready, feel free to use our [Hugo starter site](), which walks you through Forestry’s core features and provides a great starting point for your own website. -->
