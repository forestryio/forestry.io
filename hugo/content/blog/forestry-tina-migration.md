Below is a list of features currently missing from TinaCMS. Each feature falls in one of the following categories:

### Support Planned

This is a feature that we are confident will be added to TinaCMS.

### Considering Support

We are looking into this feature, and may or may not bring it forward to TinaCMS.

### Not Considering Support

We are relatively confident that this feature won't be built by the Tina team. 
Keep in mind, TinaCMS's frontend is open source, so we are open to community additions / plugins.
