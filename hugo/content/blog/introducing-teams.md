We are introducing changes to the way you manage collaborators on your sites.

Our previous model had a few limitations that we wanted to address:

* Adding a user to an organization gave each of your members access to all organization sites.
* The only way to give users "developer" or "admin" permissions on a site was to make them a "developer" or "admin" across the entire organization.
* Guests on an individual site were restricted to "editor" permissions (No access to edit front matter templates or site settings)

#### Site-specific access levels

The available roles for users within an organizations are now "Member" or "Owner".  
The access levels for users on a site are now defined on the site-level as opposed to the global organization-level.

#### Collaborators instead of Guests

Instead of having the notion of "guests" on an individual site, we now refer to these site-users as collaborators. You can add as many "internal collaborators" (users within your site's organization) as you like, and you can add 3 external collaborators (users outside of your site's organization) onto a site. These "external collaborators" (previously known as "guests") can have an editor, developer, or admin access level assigned to them.

#### Teams

You can now create teams inside of your Forestry organization. Now you can group your team members into teams, and add these teams onto individual sites.

[Check out our documentation to set up permissions your sites](/docs/settings/collaborators/).

We believe these changes are a step forward in making less assumptions about how your team collaborates on sites. We hope you love the new changes, and we can't wait to build on them to continue making our collaboration workflow more flexible!
