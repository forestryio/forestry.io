### About Forestry.io

_Helping people build a better web._

Forestry.io is creating a Git-backed content management system (CMS) focused on the JAMstack. We’re passionate about the web and value quality engineering and design. Our HQ is located in Canada, and we have a remote-friendly culture with over 50% of our team working from around the world. We're looking for people who want to join us in building a truly world-class company and CMS.

Each job posting has a list of things that we think will help the candidate be successful. You don’t need to be a “rockstar” at everything on day 1.
